So you need to create a subset using the **degree centrality** to find out find the top 4 of the most important nodes, and use them to create a subset of the original network. \n",

    "## Challenge 1: Geodemographic Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will replicate the process of creating a geodemographic classification using the k-means clustering algorithm. Please select any city in the UK except London, Liverpool, or Glasgow. The main goal is to generate a meaningful and informative classification that captures the diversity of areas in your dataset using the census data ( For England, you can try to use the 2021 or 2011 census, and for Scotland, you need to use the 2011 census data) \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the main goal for the geodemographic classification (marketing, retail and service planning). \n",
    "2. Look for census data from the selected city for which you would like to generate the geodemographic classification.\n",
    "3. The census data at the Output Area OA level. Select multiple topics of at least four topics (socio-demographics, economics, health, and so on). Describe your topic selection accordingly based on the goal of your geodemographic classification. For example, if your geodemographics are related to marketing, Economic variables might be the appropriate selection. \n",
    "4. Identify the variables that will be crucial for effectively segmenting neighbourhoods. Evaluate how this choice may impact the classification results, including a DEA analysis.\n",
    "5. Prepare, adjust or clean the dataset addressing any missing values or outliers that could distort the clustering results.\n",
    "6. Include standardisation between areas and variables. Make an appropriate analysis and adjust the variable selection accordingly for any multicollinearity.\n",
    "7. Utilize the k-means clustering algorithm to create a classification based on the selected variables.\n",
    "8. Define the optimum number of clusters (i.e., using the Elblow method). Experiment with different values of k.\n",
    "9. Evaluate your cluster groups (e.g., using PCA) and interpret your cluster centres. Describe your results and repeat the process to adjust the variable selection and cluster groups to provide more meaningful results for your geodemographic goal. Interpret the characteristics of each cluster. What demographic patterns or similarities are prevalent within each group?\n",
    "10. Map the final cluster groups\n",
    "11. Finish the analysis by naming the final clusters and plotting a final map that includes the census values and the provided names.\n",
    "12. Finally, acknowledge the subjective nature of classification and make analytical decisions to produce an optimum classification for your specific purpose. Reflect on the challenges and insights gained during the classification process. Ensure you document your analytical decisions and the rationale behind any important decision. Once your geodemographics are constructed, describe the potential use cases for the geodemographic classification you have built based on your initial goal."
